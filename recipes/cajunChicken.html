    <h1>Cajun Chicken Alfredo with Broccoli Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Nearly every popular chain restaurant has their own version of Cajun Chicken Alfredo. And although it’s probably cliche at this point, I can’t deny it’s downright irresistible. There’s something about the combination of spicy, creamy, and savory that just works. Plus, my restaurant copycat recipe gets a boost by way of Blanched Broccoli, so we can call it a healthy dinner idea, right?!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>penne pasta</li>
        <li>chicken breast cutlets</li>
        <li>homemade cajun seasoning</li>
        <li>dry white wine</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>garlic</li>
        <li>butter</li>
        <li>parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>heavy cream</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 200 degrees. In a large pot, bring 4 quarts water and 1 tablespoon salt to boil. Add pasta and cook until al dente, about 9 minutes. Remove pasta and reserve pasta cooking water in the pot.</li>
        <li>Return pasta cooking water to boil. Add broccoli and blanch until just tender and bright green, about 1 to 2 minutes. Immediately drain and plunge into a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking and set the color.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, sprinkle both sides of the chicken generously with cajun seasoning. In large skillet, heat oil until shimmering.</li>
        <li>Add chicken to skillet in a single layer and cook, flipping once, until the temperature on an internal thermometer reaches 165 degrees, about 5 minutes on each side. Transfer clean baking sheet or oven-safe plate, cover with foil, and place in oven to keep warm.</li>
        <li>Clean skillet if desired. Return skillet to stove and melt butter until foaming over medium-high heat. Stir in garlic until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Whisk in wine to deglaze the pan. Simmer until sauce has reduced by half, about 2 minutes (your pan is hot at this point so it should go pretty quickly).</li>
        <li>Whisk in cream and simmer until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Fold in parmesan cheese. Season to taste with salt and pepper (I like 1 teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper).</li>
        <li>Return pasta to skillet and toss gently to coat. In a skillet or in a large warmed bowl, pile broccoli on top of pasta, top with chicken, and garnish with more parmesan cheese.</li>
    </ol>
